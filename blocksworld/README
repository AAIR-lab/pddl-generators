The blocksworld generators use the random bw state generator provided
by John Slaney and Sylvie Thiebaux. This is contained in the

bwstates.1

subdirectory. Go there and make. Then go to

3ops/2pddl or 4ops/2pddl

and make there, too - this produces an executable that translates the
generator's output to PDDL. The random instances can then be generated
by running the script

blocksworld <ops> <num>

which takes as input the number of operators (either 3 or 4) and blocks
in the problem to be generated. This is currently maximal 200 due to
the random state generator. To increase that, edit the Makefile in
bwstates.1 and increase SIZE.
